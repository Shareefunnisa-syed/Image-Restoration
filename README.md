------------------------ Image Restoration using Multi-Scale Fusion in MATLAB -----------------------

--> A MATLAB-based project designed for content-aware image restoration using a multi-scale fusion approach.
--> This system enhances degraded images by combining multiple image processing techniques such as red channel compensation, white balance correction, gamma correction, and sharpening.
--> The goal is to extract clean and useful visual information from noisy and blurred input images and produce high-quality outputs with improved sharpness, contrast, and color balance.

Features
--> Red Channel Compensation: Enhances visibility in underwater or low-light images by boosting red pixel information.
--> White Balance Correction: Corrects lighting color imbalance to produce more natural-looking images.
--> Gamma Correction: Adjusts the luminance to enhance visibility in darker image regions.
--> Sharpening: Emphasizes image details and edge clarity to improve definition.
--> Multi-Scale Fusion: Combines outputs from various enhancement stages to form a single high-quality image.
--> Noise Reduction: Reduces visual noise to restore cleaner and clearer image content.
--> Output Display: Shows side-by-side comparison between the original and enhanced images.

Requirements
--> MATLAB R2018b or later  
--> Image Processing Toolbox  
--> No external libraries required
